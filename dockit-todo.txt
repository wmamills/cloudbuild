        x Make version of DISTRO w/ slashes converted to dashes
    x add arch option to run foreign arch
        x Make version of ARCH w/ slashes converted to dashes

    x purge older than
    x temp
    x temp-ok
    x new
    * last=no,use,update

        y|yes=use last (update does not make sense) this is default
        update=don't use last but update it
    * setup=none,distro,admin,prj
    * branch
        remote@treeish
        remote can be . for local git, remote name, or url

        default is .@WORKTREE
    * script
    * isolate
    * generic
    * read-only
    * top (dir)
    * mount (dir)
    * detached (ie no-wait)
        * check for running job in normal flow
        * implement wait & attach commands
    * add option to make an docker image based of distro setup, all setup, or full build
* processing
    x REFIX SUDO for user
    x get default options
    x make distro setup run just once
    x make prj setup run just once
    x find prj_script file
    * find (default) top dir
    * handle relative mount dirs (users home dir)
    * use top dir name as mount dir name by default
    * allow user to set shorter project name rather than H_w_proj etc
    x remove existing users that conflict (for ubuntu:23.04 etc)
    * import env settings before "make" command
    * allow multiple shells commands to be active, w/ last one out to stop

    * allow shell and build to be active at the same time
    * allow resume of distro setup if it is stopped half way through
    * add individual markers for distro_, admin_, and prj_ setup
    X require confirmation before creating a .prjinfo dir unless --new is specified
